I'm a student at the University of Florida studying Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration.</p>        <p>I began programming by making small games in high school. Over time, I came to realize how much I enjoyed the programming side, and I began to learn about what else I could create with code.          I'm interested in learning more about software and web development, as well as backend infrastructure.</p>        <p>What I love about coding is knowing that every bit of functionality or design I add to a project is a direct result of my own work and deliberate choices.        </p>      </section>      <section id="experience">        <h2>Experience</h2>        <p> I have experience in web development, <mark>C++</mark>, <Mark>Python</Mark>, <mark>React Native</mark>, and<mark>Gamemaker Language</mark>.</p>        <p>I got my start programming by making small games in Gamemaker Studio 2 for fun.</p>        <p>This culminated in me leading a small team of 3 to create a web game which went on to be commercially licensed to coolmathgames.com</p>        <p>Currently, I'm working on improving my skills and knowledge in technologies like React and FastAPI, So that I can apply them in new and exciting projects.</p>        <p>I've also been developing my proficiency in <mark>Swift</mark> and <mark>SwiftUI</mark> for native iOS, macOS, and iPadOS development.</p>      </section>      <section id="projects">        <h2>Projects</h2>        <h3>Stress Facial Recognition Website </h3>        <p><a href="https://github.com/seamushinz/stress-tracking-webapp"><b>Repository Link</b> <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/25/25231.png" alt="GitHub Icon" class="github-icon"></a></p>        <p>Using MediaPipe's facial recognition technology, <mark>FastAPI</mark>, and <mark>Next.js</mark>, I worked with a team of 3 to create a website that can detect stress in a user's faces while working on their computer.</p>        <p>Our team utilized <mark>Googleâ€™s MediaPipe</mark> Face Landmarker tool to capture facial landmark position data, which was transmitted to a Python backend via FastAPI.</p>        <p>We developed and fine-tuned stress detection parameters through iterative testing to identify facial indicators of stress.</p>        <p>When the user's stress level surpasses a custom threshold, the site will push a notification to them and provide methods of relieving stress.</p>        <p>My role involved creating front-end logic and React components, such as the webcam functionality and the de-stressing activities. I learned how to use Next.js and greatly improved my skills in React.</p>        <h3>Meal Logging Journaling App</h3>        <p><a href="https://github.com/GatorHong/DineRate"><b>Repository Link</b> <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/25/25231.png" alt="GitHub Icon" class="github-icon"></a></p>        <p>I worked alongside two teammates to create a mobile app with <mark>Expo</mark> that allows users to log meals along with a journal entry. This creates a consistent daily reminder to take time to journal.</p>        <p>My role focused on creating the front-end and design of the app, as well as small portions of the backend using <mark>mongodb</mark> to retrieve some of the user data. This was my first project working on the backend, and I intend to gain further experience in this area.</p>        <h3>Movie-Crew-Based Film Recommendation System</h3>        <p><a href="https://github.com/seamushinz/Movie-Crew-Based-Recommendation"><b>Repository Link</b> <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/25/25231.png" alt="GitHub Icon" class="github-icon"></a></p>        <p>Working with a team of 3 total, we focused on optimizing data retrieval by benchmarking our custom <mark>C++</mark> Adjacency List and Hashmap implementations. I worked on fine-tuning the data parsing to read massive files containing around 2.2 million data points and 200,000 unique movies, ultimately cutting load times by up to 50% compared to our initial setups.</p>        <p>We also used Crowcpp to provide a web-based frontend to view the movies that are recommended. Movies are recommended based off of similarities in cast and crew.</p>        <h3>Personal Website</h3>        <p><a href="https://github.com/seamushinz/seamushinz.github.io"><b>Repository Link</b> <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/25/25231.png" alt="GitHub Icon" class="github-icon"></a></p>        <p>This website was created to learn how to use <mark>HTML</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark>, and <mark>JavaScript</mark>. My goal was to keep it simple and readable yet still be memorable.</p>        <p>I created the 3D model using iOS' object scanning feature, then used Google's model-viewer API to display it on the page.</p>      </section>      <section id="links" style="padding-bottom: 60px">        <h2>Contact, Links, and Resume</h2>        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:seamushinz@icloud.com">seamushinz@ufl.edu</a> </p>        <p>          <a class="links" href="Assets/SeamusHinz_Resume.pdf">Resume </a>        </p>        <p>          <a class="links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamus-hinz-2a29ba320/">LinkedIn <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/LinkedIn_icon_circle.svg/1200px-LinkedIn_icon_circle.svg.png" alt="LinkedIn Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 4px;"></a>        </p>        <p>          <a class="links" href="https://github.com/seamushinz">Github <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/25/25231.png" alt="GitHub Icon" class="github-icon"></a>        </p>        </section>      <model-viewer id="seamus-model" src="Assets/Seamus v_0.glb" alt="A 3D model of myself, Seamus Hinz.
